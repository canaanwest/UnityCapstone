#SetUp!
In this poetry game for children, I will be utilizing Unity and the Tobii Eyetracking device. To set up the environment:

- Check the current systems requirements for the Tobii device. I am running on Windows 10.
- Procure a Tobii Eyetracker. I am using the EyeX, which is being discontinued; however, these instructions should also work for the 4C eyetracker. You will need to download the appropriate software to run this device on your computer, available here: https://tobiigaming.com/getstarted/.
- Download Visual Studio and its package for Unity. This will install the most recent version of Unity on your device. 
- Download the Tobii Gaming SDK, available here: https://github.com/Tobii/UnitySDK/releases. Each time you start a new project requiring use of the Tobii, you will need to import Tobii assets from the SDK into Unity.

#Git
- You'll need to go through the normal process of installing git on your device. 
- In addition, here is some Unity-Specific information about using git: https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-git-with-unity#a-bonus-for-github-users-automatically-collapse-generated-file-diffs
